              <h2>King Safety</h2>
              <p>King safety is no doubt, the biggest priority of every player in a game. Without the king, you only lose the game. In the opening, the King is very weak and must be tucked away. Bringing the King out in the middle game can still be risky, but some openings call for it as well. But the player must know what they're doing.</p>

              <h2>Force (Material) and Mobility</h2>
              <p>Whichever sides has more material has a good chance of winning. More material means more warriors on the board on the player's side. If there's an equal amount of warriors, the game can be very sharp and either side has to be very strategic in how they play.</p>

              <h2>Space</h2>
              <p>Like famous Grandmaster (GM) <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Seirawan">Yasser Seirawan</a></b> has once said: <br/> "Though most people love to look at the games of the great attacking masters, some of the most successful players in history have been the quiet positional players. They slowly grind you down by taking away your space, tying up your pieces, and leaving you with virtually nothing to do!" ~ Yasser Seirawan</p>

              <h2>Pawn Weakness</h2>
              <p>Every opening leaves a certain pawn weakness that can be taken control of. It is up to the player to know those weaknesses and make use of them and stop them from being a threat as soon as possible. This is due to pawn movements are permanents as pawns can never move back a square or two. "A weakness is not a weakness if it is not utilized."</p>

              <h2>Outposts</h2>
              <p>Outposts are a sub-type of pawn weakness. Not always taking pieces leads to victory. Sometimes it takes just an occupation of a certain position on the board by a minor piece can lead to victory faster than eating away your opponent's pieces. Since pawn movements are permanent, some pieces, say Bishops and Knights can make outposts in those gaps and apply pressure to the opponent. </p>

                <h2>Center Control</h2>
                <p>Center control is a more important principle in the opening, however, in the middlegame it can be quite powerful as well in some openings. With games that are considered closed (where there are no open files (columns) with no pieces on it), center control can often be crucial. Where as open games, those files can lead to more opportunities.</p>
