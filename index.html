            <h2>How to Calculate Variations</h2>
            <p>
              2 Types of Calculations:<br/>
              - Straightforward (forcing) <br/>
              - Complicated / Convoluted (non-forcing)
            </p>
            <p>
              1. Choose Candidate Moves - Look at checks, captures, and forcing moves first! <br/>
              2. Consider Your Clock Time - How much time do you have to calculate? <br/>
              3. Divide Candidate Moves Into Forcing and Non-Forcing Moves <br/>
              4. Calculate Candidate Moves - Simple moves are calculated first! <br/>
              5. Final Check, Then Decision

            <h2>Weak Squares & Outposts</h2>
            <p>Look for weak squares in your opponents' position. Look for weak squares in your own position. Plan the outpost spots. Then do your needed calculations.</p>

            <h2>Weak Color Complexes</h2>
            <p>To find weak color complexes, you'll have to locate square weaknesses within the pawn structure of both sides. You'll want to create a pawn structure depending on which pieces you have and how they are positioned. When your opponent has a certain color weakness, trade the bishop of the corresponding color.</p>

            <h2>How to Evaluate a Position</h2>
            <p>This tip is useless in openings. Usually the player should know the theory of the opening they are playing ahead of time. Once the opening phase is over though, this tip can come to play. Some general rules when evaluating a position is that if you're up on material, simplify! If you have more space, keep the minor pieces on the board. When you start evaluating a position, factor in the number of material each side has. King's safety. Piece activity. Pawn structure. And threats.</p>
